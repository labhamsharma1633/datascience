Create a new feature: Average Score

Classify students as High or Low performers

Train and evaluate classification models:

✅ Decision Tree

✅ Random Forest

✅ XGBoost (with comparison)

🔧 Technologies & Libraries
Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-Learn – Machine Learning models

XGBoost – Advanced classifier

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Score distribution by gender

Correlation heatmaps

Insights based on parental education, lunch type, and test preparation
